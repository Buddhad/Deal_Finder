# Zillow Deal Finder

### How it Works
It searches for houses for purchase or rent in a given neighborhood and calculates the difference between the list price and the ZestimateÂ® and recommends the houses with the best value. Property with list prices lower than the Zestimate will appear in green text, and property with list prices above the Zestimate will appear in red.

### Keep in mind
- Just because a list price is lower than a Zestimate or on the lower end of the value range doesn't mean you should purchase it.
- There are many factors into buying a house such as location, taxes, environment, lot size, maintenance costs, property condition, comfortability, etc. Do **not** solely use this tool to make a purchase.
- The 3rd property always needs to "load", therefore we cannot get any data about that property and it is removed.
- This is technically not allowed as Zillow only allows collection of data through one of their APIs, and since they do not have an API to search for property in a neighborhood with specific filters, this scrapes their site to find those properties. However, parts of this project **do** use multiple APIs provided by Zillow. (They also require an end user product on a website and API branding to be located visibly on the website).

### Config structure
Create a file called `config.json`, copy over the text from `config.json.example`, and edit the necessary information.
```
{
    "ZWSID": "Your ZWS-ID you got from registering",
    "neighborhood": "Great Neck, NY",
    "sort": "days",           // sort by parameter: see options below
    "filters": {
        "price_min": 0,       // minimum house price
        "price_max": 1000000, // maximum house price (leave at 0 for no maximum, -1 for rent only)
        "rent_min": 0,        // minimum rent price
        "rent_max": 3000,     // maximum rent price (leave at 0 for no maximum, -1 for purchase only)
        "beds": "2+",         // Number of bedrooms (str) can be i, i+, 0 for studio: from 0-5, or -1 for Any
        "baths": 3,           // Sets minimum number of baths: 0 (Any), 1, 1.5, 2, 3, or 4
        "sqft_min": 1400,     // minimum square footage
        "sqft_max": 3000      // maximum square footage (set to 0 for no maximum)
    }
}
```
**Sort options:**
- "priced" - Sort by price from high to low
- "pricea" - Sort by price from low to high
- "days" - Sort by new
- "beds" - Sort by bedrooms
- "baths" - Sort by bathrooms
- "size" - Sort by square footage
- "lot" - Sort by lot size
- "zest" - Sort by Zestimate price from high to low
